Our website allows you to analyse your medical X-ray of the eye and determine whether it has cancer or not. If so, we'll tell you which one(s).
All you need to do is upload your file below in .jpg, .png or .jpeg format and we will take care of the rest.
Our website will provide a personalised analysis based on the results obtained.
